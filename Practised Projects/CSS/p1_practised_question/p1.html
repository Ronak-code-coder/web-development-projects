    <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
    <p>
        Manali is believed to be the home of Sage Manu, the legendary creator of mankind in 
        Hindu mythology. According to ancient texts, after a great flood, he stepped off his 
        ark in this very region to restart human civilization—giving Manali its name 
        and spiritual importance.
